## Key Considerations

### 1. Translatable Fields
- `name` and `description` are JSON objects `{ "en": "...", "ar": "..." }`
- Always send both locales on create; on update you can send just the changed one
- The response returns the translated value based on `app()->getLocale()`

### 2. Product Type
- `simple`: Single product with one price/SKU/stock
- `variable`: Has `variants[]` array with different prices, SKUs, and attribute combinations
- When creating a variable product, include `variants` array. The `price` field is not required (derived from variants)

### 3. Variants
- Each variant has `attribute_values: [id1, id2, ...]` referencing `attribute_values` table
- On update, sending new variants DELETES all old variants and recreates them
- Variant attributes link to `attribute_product` pivot table

### 4. Images
- Images are uploaded as file arrays on create
- On update, send existing image IDs + new files
- Managed by Spatie Media Library

### 5. Discount vs Flash Sale
- `has_discount` + `discount_type`/`discount_amount`: Regular discount
- `has_flash_sale` + `flash_sale_id`: Flash sale discount
- Both can be active simultaneously; `price_after_flash_sale` takes precedence
- Current effective price is in `current_price` field

### 6. Pricing Fields
- `price`: Base price
- `current_price`: Current effective price (accounting for discounts/flash sales)
- `price_after_discount`: Price after regular discount (before flash sale)
- `price_after_flash_sale`: Price after flash sale discount

### 7. Soft Delete
- Products use soft deletes (`deleted_at`)
- Currently no restore endpoint exists

### 8. Search
- Searches across translatable `name`, `description`, `sku`, and variant SKUs
- Uses `LIKE %term%` on JSON fields

### 9. Filters
- `category`: Filter by category slug
- `banner`: Filter by banner slug
- `flash_sale`: Filter by flash sale slug
- `promotion`: Filter by promotion slug
- `slider`: Filter by slider slug
- `status`: Filter by product status
- `date_range`: Filter by date range `YYYY-MM-DD//YYYY-MM-DD`
