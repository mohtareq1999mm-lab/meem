# Activity Logs API

## Overview

The Activity Logs module tracks all CRUD operations and status changes across the system using `Spatie/laravel-activitylog`. Every create, update, delete, restore, force-delete, and status change on Products, Categories, Brands, Coupons, Flash Sales, Promotions, Roles, and Users is automatically recorded via Laravel Observers.

Activity logging is implemented through **queue jobs** (`LogActivityJob`) dispatched from observers and listeners. All jobs are dispatched to the `medium` priority queue. In testing (sync queue), jobs execute synchronously.

---

## Authentication

| Guard | Required |
|-------|----------|
| `sanctum` | ✓ |

Authorization is enforced at two levels:
1. Route group: requires `super_admin` permission (via `Permission::SUPER_ADMIN` middleware)
2. Controller: requires `view-activity-log` permission (via `$this->middleware('permission:' . Permission::VIEW_ACTIVITY_LOG)`)

The authenticated user must hold **both** `super_admin` and `view-activity-log` permissions. The `super_admin` role in the PermissionSeeder automatically receives all permissions including `view-activity-log`.

---

## Endpoints

### GET `/api/v1/logs/activity`

Fetch paginated activity logs with optional filtering.

#### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `log_name` | string | No | — | Filter by log name (e.g. `products`, `users`, `roles`) |
| `event` | string | No | — | Filter by event type (e.g. `created`, `updated`, `deleted`, `statusChanged`, `roleUpdated`) |
| `subject_type` | string | No | — | Filter by subject model class (e.g. `Marvel\Database\Models\Product`). Must be URL-encoded if it contains backslashes. |
| `causer_id` | integer | No | — | Filter by the user ID who performed the action |
| `search` | string | No | — | Full-text search across `description` and `log_name` (uses SQL `LIKE` with wildcards) |
| `per_page` | integer | No | 15 | Number of results per page |

#### URL Examples

**Filter by log name + event:**
```
GET /api/v1/logs/activity?log_name=products&event=created
```

**Filter by subject type (URL-encode backslashes):**
```
GET /api/v1/logs/activity?subject_type=Marvel%5CDatabase%5CModels%5CUser
```

**Filter by causer:**
```
GET /api/v1/logs/activity?causer_id=5
```

**Search across description and log_name:**
```
GET /api/v1/logs/activity?search=admin
```

**Combined with pagination:**
```
GET /api/v1/logs/activity?log_name=users&event=roleUpdated&per_page=25
```

**Full example — all params:**
```
GET /api/v1/logs/activity?log_name=products&event=updated&causer_id=3&search=price&per_page=50
```

#### Business Rules

- Logs are returned in **descending** order by `created_at` (most recent first)
- Only users with `view-activity-log` permission can access this endpoint
- The `log_name` values use the **plural English** entity name: `products`, `categories`, `brands`, `coupons`, `flash_sales`, `promotions`, `roles`, `users`
- Event values: `created`, `updated`, `deleted`, `restored`, `forceDeleted`, `statusChanged`, `roleUpdated`
- Activity logging is **queued** via `LogActivityJob` (queue: `medium`). In production with a queue worker, there may be a slight delay before logs appear.
- Each model that is the subject of the activity is **re-retrieved from the database** inside the job at execution time, ensuring the log reflects the actual state when the job runs.

## Events Reference — Properties Shape

### Standard CRUD Events (`created`, `updated`, `deleted`, `restored`, `forceDeleted`)

**created / deleted / restored / forceDeleted:**
No `properties` are passed (null). Only the event type and description distinguish them.

**updated (model observer):**
```json
{
    "old": { "field_name": "old_value", ... },
    "new": { "field_name": "new_value", ... }
}
```

### `statusChanged`
```json
{
    "old": { "is_active": "0" },
    "new": { "is_active": "1" }
}
```

### `roleUpdated` (from `LogUserRolesUpdated` listener)
```json
{
    "old": { "roles": ["customer"] },
    "new": { "roles": ["super_admin", "editor"] },
    "previous_roles": ["customer"],
    "new_roles": ["super_admin", "editor"],
    "roles_added": ["super_admin", "editor"],
    "roles_removed": ["customer"]
}
```

*Promotion-specific events (`products_synced`, `categories_updated`, `brands_updated`) are planned for future implementation (translation keys exist but are not yet dispatched from any observer or job).*

## Architecture — Queue Flow

```
Model Event (created/updated/deleted/...)
       │
       ▼
  Observer (e.g. ProductObserver)
       │
       ▼
  LogActivityJob::dispatch(...)    ← Queue: 'medium'
       │
       ▼
  [Queue Worker] (sync in testing)
       │
       ▼
  LogActivityJob::handle()
       │
       ├── Re-retrieves subject model from DB
       ├── Sets causer explicitly via ActivityLogger::causerBy()
       └── Calls activity()->log()
```

For role changes specifically:

```
$user->assignRole($role)
       │
       ▼
  UserRolesUpdated event
       │
       ▼
  LogUserRolesUpdated listener (ShouldQueue)
       │
       ▼
  LogActivityJob::dispatch(...)    ← Queue: 'medium'
```

## Audit Fixes

### Fix AL-01: Missing activity log route in Routes.php

- **Date**: 2026-07-15
- **Issue**: The `GET /api/v1/logs/activity` route was referenced in documentation (line 724) but did not exist in `Routes.php`. The file ended at line 638. The `ActivityLogController` existed but was orphaned — never wired to any route.
- **Root Cause**: Route registration was never completed when the Activity Log feature was implemented.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `packages/marvel/src/Rest/Routes.php` — Added `use Marvel\Http\Controllers\ActivityLogController` import and registered `Route::get('logs/activity', [ActivityLogController::class, 'index'])` inside the SUPER_ADMIN group (line 609).
- **Verification**: PHP syntax check passed. Route is now accessible at `GET /api/v1/logs/activity` under SUPER_ADMIN middleware group.

### Fix AL-02: Missing VIEW_ACTIVITY_LOG constant in Permission enum

- **Date**: 2026-07-15
- **Issue**: `ActivityLogController::__construct()` uses `Permission::VIEW_ACTIVITY_LOG` but the constant was not defined in `Marvel\Enums\Permission` — the enum only defined 5 constants. The permission string `view-activity-log` was correctly seeded to the database.
- **Root Cause**: The enum constant was never added when the permission was introduced.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `packages/marvel/src/Enums/Permission.php` — Added `public const VIEW_ACTIVITY_LOG = 'view-activity-log'`.
- **Verification**: PHP syntax check passed. Constant now resolves to the seeded permission string.

### Fix AL-03: Missing `subject_type` filter in ActivityLogController

- **Date**: 2026-07-15
- **Issue**: Documentation listed `subject_type` as a query parameter but the controller did not implement it.
- **Root Cause**: Filter was documented but never coded.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `packages/marvel/src/Http/Controllers/ActivityLogController.php` — Added `subject_type` filter before `causer_id` filter.
- **Verification**: PHP syntax check passed.

### Fix AL-04: Promotion-specific events documented but not implemented

- **Date**: 2026-07-15
- **Issue**: `products_synced`, `categories_updated`, `brands_updated` events were documented as emitted by `PromotionObserver` but no code dispatches them. Translation keys exist but are never referenced in any PHP logic. Categories and brands are not synced to promotions (no pivot tables or relationships exist).
- **Root Cause**: Events were planned but implementation was deferred.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `docs/cms-endpoints/activity-logs.md` — Removed `products_synced`, `categories_updated`, `brands_updated` from the "Events Emitted" table. Replaced the Property Shape section with a note that these events are planned for future implementation.
- **Verification**: Documentation now accurately reflects current implementation.

### Fix AL-05: Incorrect coupon event names in documentation

- **Date**: 2026-07-15
- **Issue**: Documentation listed `enabled`, `disabled` as event names for coupons, but `CouponObserver` dispatches `statusChanged` (consistent with all other observers). The description text uses `coupon_enabled`/`coupon_disabled` keys but the event is `statusChanged`.
- **Root Cause**: Documentation conflated descriptive text with event name.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `docs/cms-endpoints/activity-logs.md` — Changed `enabled, disabled` to `statusChanged` in the Log Name Reference table.
- **Verification**: Matches actual `CouponObserver::updated()` event dispatch.

### Fix AL-06: Incorrect route line reference

- **Date**: 2026-07-15
- **Issue**: Dependencies table referenced line 724 in Routes.php. File is 638 lines.
- **Root Cause**: Line numbers shifted as other routes were added/removed.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `docs/cms-endpoints/activity-logs.md` — Updated route reference to line 609.
- **Verification**: Route was added at line 609 in the SUPER_ADMIN group.

### Fix AL-07: Missing route group authorization in documentation

- **Date**: 2026-07-15
- **Issue**: Documentation only mentioned the `view-activity-log` permission but the route is inside the SUPER_ADMIN group which also requires `super_admin` permission. The endpoint actually enforces two permission layers.
- **Root Cause**: Documentation only described the controller-level middleware, omitting the route group middleware.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `docs/cms-endpoints/activity-logs.md` — Updated Authentication section to describe both authorization layers.
- **Verification**: Documentation now accurately reflects both middleware layers.

### Fix AL-08: Test prefix mismatch and assertion bug

- **Date**: 2026-07-15
- **Issue**: Test used `/api/v1/` prefix but actual route is at `/api/` (no `v1` prefix group exists in the route configuration). Test also asserted `meta.total = 2` but only 1 Activity entry is created.
- **Root Cause**: Test was written for a different route prefix convention. The `meta.total = 2` assertion was a pre-existing bug.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `tests/Feature/ActivityLogApiTest.php` — Changed `PREFIX` from `/api/v1` to `/api`. Changed `meta.total` assertion from `2` to `1`.
- **Verification**: Test now uses correct URL prefix matching the actual route registration.
