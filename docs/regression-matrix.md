# Regression Matrix

When a feature is modified, ALL dependent features and their test suites must be re-run.

---

## Role & Permission

**Changed Feature:**
Role & Permission

**Affected Features:**
- Admin Users
- User Management
- All middleware-guarded endpoints

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| RoleAndPermissionTest | PASS | 32/32 tests passed on 2026-07-20 (159 assertions) |
| Admin Users | NOT RUN | Feature not audited yet |
| User Management | NOT RUN | Feature not audited yet |

**Changes Applied (Revision 2):**
- `Routes.php`: Removed duplicate unauthenticated role/permission routes (lines 136–138, 146–158) — fixes Bugs 1, 4, 5, 6 (403 on all permission endpoints, user detail missing roles, remove-role/user-permission 403)
- `RoleAndPermissionController.php`: Changed `addRole()`/`updateRole()` from mass-assignment to explicit property assignment to avoid HasTranslations trait conflict — fixes Bug 2 (display_name stored as false)
- `RoleResource.php`: Added `name`, `guard_name`, `created_at`, `updated_at` fields — fixes Bug 3 (roles list missing fields)
- `destroyRole()`: Added `$role->users()->count() > 0` check returning 409 conflict — fixes Bug 7 (delete role with assigned users succeeds silently)
- `UserController.php`: Added `permissions` + `role` to `token()` login response — fixes Bug 8 (login missing permissions/role)
- `RoleAndPermissionTest.php`: Updated pagination assertion for flattened response structure; updated cascade delete test to assert 409 conflict

## Flash Sales

**Changed Feature:**
Flash Sales

**Affected Features:**
- Products — flash sale pricing enrichment
- Cart — flash sale pricing applied in cart
- Orders — order creation pricing

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| FlashSaleRegressionTest | PASS | 4/4 tests pass |
| FlashSaleReorderTest | PASS | 3/3 tests pass |
| FlashSaleApproveRequestTest | PASS | 4/4 tests pass |
| FlashSaleProductionHardenTest | PASS | 26/26 new tests pass |
| PricingCacheInvalidationTest | 2 ERRORS, 3 FAILURES (PRE-EXISTING) | Unrelated to changes (product_variants table missing in test env) |
| ProductPricingServiceTest | PASS | 34/34 tests pass |
| OrderCreationFlowTest | PASS | 15/15 tests pass |

**Changes Applied (Revision 4):**
- `FlashSaleProductProcess.php`: Fixed BUG-1 — `processNewlyAddedProductInFlashSale()` now sets `has_flash_sale = true` and `price_after_flash_sale`; `unsetProductFromFlashSale()` now sets `has_flash_sale = false` and `price_after_flash_sale = null`
- `FlashSaleProductProcess.php`: Fixed BUG-4 — replaced non-existent `variation_options` relationship with `variations`; replaced bulk `Variation::where(...)->update(...)` with `$variation->save()`; removed dead `$product->sale_price = null` writes (column does not exist on products table)
- `OrderCreationFlowTest.php`: Fixed pre-existing test bug — `product_without_variant_still_uses_product_price` expected `product_discount_price = 80.00` but flash sale override means it should be null
- Created `FlashSaleProductionHardenTest.php`: 26 tests covering has_flash_sale lifecycle, admin CRUD, pricing priority, flash sale types, resources, validation, auth, soft delete, route ordering, model scopes

---

## Products (Item Type — Rev 2, 2026-08-23)

- Promotions — promotion rules apply to products
- Coupons — coupon conditions apply to products

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| ProductItemTypeTest | PASS | 13/13 tests, 31 assertions (new feature suite) |
| ProductCrudTest | PASS | 63/63 |
| ProductAdminTest | PASS | 17/17 |
| ProductsEndpointTest (General/Search/Home strategies) | PASS | 57/57 |
| ProductCacheTest | PASS | 5/5 |
| ProductImportTest | PASS | 34/34 |
| ProductCurrencyTest | PASS | 8/8 |
| CartExpirationTest | PASS | 8/8 |
| FlashSalesEndpointTest | PASS | All green |
| ProductExportTest | NOT VERIFIED | Pre-existing failure: `/products/export` route does not exist in HEAD (dead endpoint); unrelated to item_type |
| ProductFilterTest | FAIL (pre-existing) | Detail-view `filters` suppression relies on non-existent `general-product-show` route name; verified absent in HEAD. Unrelated to item_type |
| CartApiTest (coupon cases) | NOT VERIFIED | Fails on uncommitted FCM workstream: `Driver [fcm] not supported` from modified Notifications; unrelated to item_type |
| WishlistApiTest | NOT VERIFIED | Route-definition drift predating this change (toggle PATCH vs test POST expectations); unrelated to item_type |
| AttributesProductionHardenTest (attribute-value routes) | NOT VERIFIED | Routes commented out in Rest/Routes.php since before this change; unrelated to item_type |
| DimensionFilterTest | NOT VERIFIED | SQLite lacks REGEXP_REPLACE (MySQL-only) used by range filters; pre-existing platform limitation |
| Orders / Checkout / Promotions / Coupons suites | NOT RUN | Blocked by same pre-existing FCM notification failures; product-facing code paths unchanged for these consumers |

**Changes Applied (Revision 2):**
- NEW `packages/marvel/src/Enums/ItemType.php` — BenSampo enum PHYSICAL/DIGITAL/SERVICE
- NEW `database/migrations/2026_08_23_105834_add_item_type_to_products_table.php` — enum column, default PHYSICAL, indexed, after product_type
- `Product.php` — fillable += item_type
- `ShopServiceProvider.php` — registered ItemType enum
- `ProductCreateRequest.php` / `ProductUpdateRequest.php` — `sometimes + Rule::in(ItemType::getValues())`
- `Marvel Http/Resources/product/ProductResource.php`, `App ProductResource.php`, `App ProductMiniResource.php` — serialize item_type
- `tests/Concerns/CreatesTestTables.php` — shared schema += item_type default PHYSICAL
- NEW `tests/Feature/ProductItemTypeTest.php`
- Docs: `api-desc/product/api.md`, `api-desc/front/product/api.md`

**Backward Compatibility:** Existing products resolve to PHYSICAL via DB default; clients omitting item_type are unaffected; product_type semantics untouched.

---

## Attributes + Attribute Values

**Changed Feature:**
Attributes + Attribute Values

**Affected Features:**
- Products — product variants depend on attribute values; product filtering by attribute slugs
- Cart — cart items reference product_variant_id (indirect)
- Orders — order items snapshot product variant data
- Import/Export — variant import creates/finds attribute values and pivot records

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| AttributeApiTest | PASS (14/16 — 2 pre-existing 403/401 test bugs) | Unchanged test suite passes |
| AttributesProductionHardenTest | PASS (32/32) | All new hardening tests pass |
| PricingCacheInvalidationTest | 2 ERRORS, 3 FAILURES (PRE-EXISTING) | Unrelated (product_variants table missing in test env) |

**Changes Applied:**
- `AttributeRepository.php`: Fixed BUG-A — updateAttribute now diffs values by slug instead of delete+recreate; preserves existing values and their product-variant associations
- `AttributeRequest.php`: Fixed BUG-B — proper nested validation for `values.*.value.en` and `values.*.value.ar`
- Created `2026_07_19_000001_add_unique_constraints_to_attributes.php`: unique indexes on `attribute_values(attribute_id, slug)` and `attribute_product(attribute_value_id, product_variant_id)`
- Created `AttributesProductionHardenTest.php`: 32 tests covering CRUD, auth, validation, cascade, resource structure, BUG-A regression

---

Product Import/Export

**Affected Features:**
- Products — import creates/updates products; export reads products
- Attributes — import creates/finds attribute values for variants
- Categories/Brands/Tags/FlashSales/Sliders — import syncs relations
- Pricing — import relies on ProductPricingService for pricing computation
- Inventory — import sets stock quantities on products and variants

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| ProductImportTest | PASS (34/34) | All import tests pass (33 existing + 1 new regression test) |
| ProductExportTest | PASS (4/4) | All export tests pass |
| ProductSuite | PASS (76/76) | All Product feature tests pass (no change to product code) |

**Changes Applied:**
- `ImportProductsJob.php`: Added `$service->finalizeVariants()` call after Excel import — orphaned variants from re-imports are now properly cleaned up
- `ProductImportTest.php`: Added `test_finalize_variants_removes_orphaned_variants` — regression test verifying orphaned variant deletion

---

## Contacts

**Changed Feature:**
Contacts

**Affected Features:**
- Notifications — `ContactMessageReceived` event triggers admin notification
- Contact Forms — public store endpoint

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| ContactAuthenticationTest | PASS | All contact auth tests pass |
| ContactAuthorizationTest | PASS | All contact permission tests pass |
| ContactCrudTest | PASS | All CRUD tests pass |

- `Routes.php`: Updated route target from `sendReplay` to `sendReply`

---

## Authentication

**Changed Feature:**
Authentication

**Affected Features:**
- All features — every API endpoint requires auth

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All Feature Tests | NOT RUN | No dedicated auth test suite exists |

**Changes Applied (Revision 1):**
- `.env`: MAIL_MAILER changed from `smtp` to `log` — password reset emails logged instead of SMTP delivery
- `UserController.php`: Added try/catch in `sendUserOtp()` for mail failure resilience
- `UserController.php`: Refactored `verifyForgetPasswordToken()` to return proper JSON response (was returning raw boolean)
- `UserController.php`: Extracted `checkResetToken()` private method for internal use by `resetPassword()`
- `resources/lang/en/message.php`: Added 4 missing password reset translation keys
- Created `api-decs/auth/authentication.md`: Auth endpoint documentation
- Created `api-decs/auth/password-reset.md`: Password reset endpoint documentation
- Created `api-decs/bug-fixed/smtp-password-reset-fix.md`: Bug fix report

---

## Categories

**Changed Feature:**
Categories

**Affected Features:**
- Categories — products_count consistency in category-by-slug endpoint

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| CategoryResourceTest | PASS (7/7) | Existing resource tests pass |
| CategoryProductsCountConsistencyTest | PASS (4/4) | New regression tests — count matches products array length |
| CategoryCombinedSuite | PASS (98/98) | All 98 category tests pass (94 existing + 4 new) |

**Changes Applied (Revision 2):**
- `app/Services/General/CategoryService.php`: Changed `withCount('products')` to `withCount(['products' => fn($q) => $this->applyChannelHomeFilter($q)])` — the count now uses the same channel filter as the eager-loaded products, fixing `products_count` mismatch when the home context filters out fast-shipping products
- Created `tests/Feature/Categories/CategoryProductsCountConsistencyTest.php`: 4 tests covering the bug regression

---

## Cart (Bulk Items)

**Changed Feature:**
Cart — `pluckItemsToCart` method (POST /cart/bulk-items)

**Affected Features:**
- Cart — bulk item addition behavior changed

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| CartApiTest — bulk tests | PASS (6/6) | Skip non-existent products, mixed valid/invalid, stock failure skip, all-fail returns empty cart |

**Changes Applied (Revision 3):**
- `CartController.php`: Removed outer DB transaction — each item processed independently; failed items caught per-item and reported in `failed_items` array
- `CartController.php`: Added `failed_items` to response — each entry has `product_id`, `product_variant_id`, `reason`
- `CartController.php`: Removed unused `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB` import
- `CartApiTest.php`: Updated `test_bulk_add_rolls_back_on_failure` → `test_bulk_add_skips_stock_failures_and_continues` (asserts 201 with failed_items)
- `CartApiTest.php`: Added `test_bulk_add_skips_all_failures_returns_empty_cart` — all items fail, null cart returned

---

## Cart (Documentation Audit)

**Changed Feature:**
Cart — Revision 4 documentation audit (all 12 `api-desc/cart/` files). No application code changed.

**Affected Features:**
- Cart — documentation contract corrections (routes, request fields, response codes/shapes)
- Checkout — uses cart totals (no behavior change)
- Orders — order origin is cart checkout (no behavior change)

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| CartApiTest | BLOCKED (re-run) | Last verified 61/65 on 2026-07-29 (4 pre-existing failures: gift promotion, finalization, resource structure). 2026-08-04 run could not execute — every test errors at bootstrap with `Class "Role" not found` (Routes.php:699), a global test-env issue unrelated to cart |
| CartExpirationTest | PASS (8/8) | Last verified 2026-07-29 |
| CartApiTest — bulk tests | PASS (6/6, 34 assertions) | Last verified 2026-07-29 |

---

## Cart (Route Bootstrap Fix)

**Changed Feature:**
Cart — Revision 5. Fixed a global test-bootstrap `ParseError` in `packages/marvel/src/Rest/Routes.php:493` that blocked **every** test suite from booting (not just cart). Lines 492-502 were a botched comment-out: `Route::group(` (line 492) was commented but its array argument (line 493) was not, leaving a dangling array literal → `syntax error, unexpected token ","`. Root cause of the earlier `Class "Role" not found` symptom; `use Marvel\Enums\Role;` was always present (line 7) and the enum autoloads correctly (`vendor/autoload.php` → `bool(true)`).

**Affected Features:**
- All test suites (global bootstrap) — was blocking 100% of PHPUnit runs
- Cart — verified after fix

**Change Made:**
- `packages/marvel/src/Rest/Routes.php:493` — commented out the dangling array to match the surrounding commented-out `Route::group` block. No route behavior changed; the block was already fully disabled.

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| CartApiTest | 75/80 PASS (330 assertions) | 5 pre-existing failures: `test_apply_coupon_to_cart` (coupon discount 405 not applied), `add_regular_item_does_not_overwrite_gift_item` (gift promotion null vs 999), `finalize_scheduled_items_only_keeps_fast_items` (BUG-CART-002), `finalize_fast_items_only_keeps_scheduled_items` (BUG-CART-002), `gift_item_attribute_not_exposed_in_item_resource` (`is_gift` key exposed — BUG-CART-011) |
| CartExpirationTest | PASS (8/8, 16 assertions) | 2026-08-04 |
| Full Cart Suite | 83/88 PASS | 2026-08-04 |

**Changes Applied (Revision 4):**
- Documentation-only corrections to match source: routes at Routes.php:149-157; `GET /cart` reads `limit` (not `per_page`); `PUT /update-item` requires `item.operation`; clear-cart coupon warning is HTTP 200 + success:true; bulk-items returns 201 with `cart`/`skipped_product_ids`/`failed_items`; `coupon` object = CouponResource shape; `product` = `{id,name,slug,thumbnail}`.
- Updated `docs/production-status.md`, `docs/feature-dependencies.md`, `docs/production-history.md`.
- Full regression re-run REQUIRED once the test bootstrap (`Class "Role" not found`) is fixed.

---

## Wishlist

**Changed Feature:**
Wishlist

**Affected Features:**
- Authentication — all wishlist routes now behind `auth:sanctum`
- Products — `ProductController::myWishlists` returns ProductResource collection
- ProductPricing — WishlistResource consumes pricing accessors (no direct service calls)
- Home / Product listing — `in_wishlist` field consumed by frontend

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| WishlistApiTest | PASS (36/36, 106 assertions) | New suite — 2026-08-04 |
| ProductSuite | NOT RUN | ProductController::myWishlists changed — re-run recommended |
| ProductPricingServiceTest | NOT RUN | Pricing accessors consumed by WishlistResource — re-run recommended |

**Changes Applied (Revision 2):**
- `Routes.php`: Wrapped `wishlists/toggle`, `wishlists` apiResource, `my-wishlists` in `auth:sanctum` group; restricted apiResource to `only(['index', 'store', 'destroy'])` — BUG-WISH-001/004
- `WishlistController.php`: `index()` scoped to `$request->user()->id` (BUG-WISH-002); `destroy()`/`delete()` aligned on `product_variant_id` (BUG-WISH-003); `store()` returns translated 400 on duplicate
- `WishlistRepository.php`: Added `findUserWishlistItem()` with explicit `whereNull`/`where` clauses replacing Prettus `findOneWhere` `= NULL` (BUG-WISH-005)
- `WishlistCreateRequest.php`: Removed `sometimes` from `product_variant_id` rules — fixes `requiredIf` bypass (BUG-WISH-006)
- `ProductController.php`: `myWishlists()` returns `ProductResource::collection($paginator)` (BUG-WISH-007)
- Created `tests/Feature/WishlistApiTest.php` (36 tests / 106 assertions)

---

## Site Reviews

**Changed Feature:**
Site Reviews (Revision 2 — API investigation + bug fixes)

**Affected Features:**
- Authentication — customer `POST /api/v1/general/site-reviews` behind `auth:sanctum`
- Permissions — 3 new permissions (`view-site-reviews`, `approve-site-reviews`, `reject-site-reviews`) added to PermissionSeeder
- User model — `site_reviews.user_id` + `moderated_by` FKs to users
- FrontendResource — new `SITE_REVIEWS` cache tag
- Routes — 3 admin `{id}` routes now constrained with `whereNumber('id')` (BUG-SR-001)
- Admin list — `limit` query param normalized (BUG-SR-002)

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| SiteReviewCreationTest | PASS (12/12) | Create, pending default, mass-assignment guards, validation, unauth |
| SiteReviewPublicApiTest | PASS (7/7) | Approved-only visibility, no moderation fields, customer name |
| SiteReviewModerationTest | PASS (17/17) | Approve/reject flows, admin id/timestamp, transitions, 404 |
| SiteReviewAdminApiTest | PASS (11/11) | Admin list/detail, moderator name, status filter, N+1 guard |
| SiteReviewRelationshipsTest | PASS (8/8) | user/moderator relations, factory states |
| SiteReviewBugRegressionTest | PASS (4/4) | NEW (Rev 2) — non-numeric id → 404 not 500; negative/zero/non-numeric/oversized limit normalization |

**Changes Applied (Revision 1):**
- Created `SiteReviewStatus` enum, `site_reviews` migration, `SiteReview` model, `SiteReviewService`, `CreateSiteReviewRequest`, `SiteReviewResource`, `AdminSiteReviewResource`, customer + admin controllers, `SiteReviewFactory`, `SiteReviewSeeder`
- Added 3 permission constants + seeder + en/ar permission translations; 4 message constants + en/ar translations
- Added 2 customer routes (`routes/api.php`) and 4 admin routes (`packages/marvel/src/Rest/Routes.php`)
- Created `tests/Feature/SiteReviews/` suite — 54 tests / 141 assertions

**Changes Applied (Revision 2):**
- `packages/marvel/src/Rest/Routes.php`: Added `->whereNumber('id')` to the 3 admin `{id}` routes (`show`/`approve`/`reject`) — BUG-SR-001 (non-numeric id → HTTP 500 TypeError)
- `packages/marvel/src/Http/Controllers/SiteReviewController.php::index()`: `$limit = max(1, min((int) $request->query('limit', 15), 100))` — BUG-SR-002 (`?limit=-5` → SQL `LIMIT -5` → QueryException → 409; no upper bound)
- Created `tests/Feature/SiteReviews/SiteReviewBugRegressionTest.php` (4 tests)
- Full suite now 58 tests / 152 assertions all passing

---

## Currency Selection Enabled

**Changed Feature:**
Currency Selection Enabled (Revision 1)

**Affected Features:**
- Settings — `settings.options.currency_selection_enabled` added; `SettingsRequest` boolean rule; `SettingsController::update()` merge; `SettingResource` top-level field
- CurrencyService — `getEffectiveCode()` gated by `isCurrencySelectionEnabled()` when disabled
- Cart / Products — effective-currency-driven prices
- Checkout / Orders — order currency snapshot at creation

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| CurrencySelectionEnabledTest | PASS (17/17, 37 assertions) | New suite — service flag, effective-currency gating, admin CRUD, validation, cache flush, isolation |
| UserCurrencyPreferenceTest | PASS | Existing suite — enabled-path resolution preserved via `CurrencyTestCase` default `true` |
| ProductCurrencyTest | PASS | Existing suite |
| OrderCurrencyTest | PASS | Existing suite |
| OrderItemSnapshotTest | PASS | Existing suite |
| PaymentCurrencyTest | PASS | Existing suite |
| ProductCacheTest | PASS | Existing suite |
| SettingsCrudTest | PASS (3/3) | Existing suite |
| SettingsValidationTest | PASS (6/6) | Existing suite |
| SettingsRegressionTest | PASS (10/10) | Existing suite |
| SettingsAuthenticationTest | 1 PRE-EXISTING FAILURE | `guests_can_view_settings` — expects guest 200 on auth-protected `/api/v1/settings`; fails identically without this feature's changes |
| FinancialDeepAuditTest | 1 PRE-EXISTING FAILURE | `settings_api_returns_minimum_order_amount` — same guest-401 expectation issue; unrelated to this feature |

**Combined Currency + Settings + Related Filter:** 183 passed / 2 failed (574 assertions) — the 2 failures are pre-existing and unrelated (verified by re-running them against the codebase without this feature's changes).

**Changes Applied (Revision 1):**
- `app/Services/Currency/CurrencyService.php`: Added memoized `isCurrencySelectionEnabled()` reading `settings.options.currency_selection_enabled` (default `false`); `getEffectiveCode()` returns catalog code when disabled; `forgetEffectiveCode()` resets the memoized flag
- `packages/marvel/src/Http/Requests/SettingsRequest.php`: Added `currency_selection_enabled => ['sometimes','boolean']`
- `packages/marvel/src/Http/Controllers/SettingsController.php`: Merges top-level `currency_selection_enabled` into `settings.options` (preserving base/catalog/currency options); calls `CurrencyService::forgetEffectiveCode()` after the update
- `packages/marvel/src/Http/Resources/SettingResource.php`: Exposes top-level `currency_selection_enabled` (default `false`)
- `database/seeders/SettingSeeder.php`: Defaults `currency_selection_enabled => false`
- `tests/Feature/Currency/CurrencyTestCase.php`: `createSettings()` defaults `currency_selection_enabled => true` to preserve the existing suite's enabled-path tests
- Created `tests/Feature/Currency/CurrencySelectionEnabledTest.php` (17 tests / 37 assertions)

---

- Coupons — existing CRUD and consumption tests

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |

- Created `UpdateCouponAssignmentRequest.php`: Validation for update (max_uses sometimes, expires_at nullable)
- Created `CouponAssignmentResource.php`: Computed remaining (max_uses - used), is_expired (expires_at in past), eager-loaded user data
- `Permission.php`: Added 4 constants (VIEW_COUPON_ASSIGNMENTS, CREATE_COUPON_ASSIGNMENT, UPDATE_COUPON_ASSIGNMENT, DELETE_COUPON_ASSIGNMENT)
- `Routes.php`: Added 5 routes in super_admin group at lines 720-726
- `constants.php`: Added 7 constants for response messages and errors
- `message.php` (en + ar): Added 7 translation keys
- Created `CouponAssignmentApiTest.php`: 30 tests covering auth, CRUD, edge cases, computed fields
- Created `CouponAssignmentValidationTest.php`: 13 tests covering validation rules
| AttributeCombinedSuite | PASS (48/48) | 2026-07-19 | All Attribute + Attribute Values tests pass (16 existing + 32 new) after 3 bug fixes |
| CartBulkItemsSuite | PASS (6/6 new, 61/65 full suite) | 2026-07-29 | 4 pre-existing failures unrelated (gift promotion, finalization, resource structure) |

--------------------------------------------------

Changed Feature:
Orders (Canonical Status Lifecycle) — Revision 1 — 2026-08-22

Affected Features:

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| OrderStatusLifecycleTest | PASS (15/15, 45 assertions) | New canonical lifecycle coverage: transitions matrix, delivered event ×1, completion payment-success semantics, gateway opt-out, COD/Cashier single-event, invoice-on-first-leave (processing/completed/cancelled + no-duplicate chain + same-status exclusion + COD single invoice), pickup null-safety |
| OrdersProductionHardenTest | PASS (38/38) | Full harden suite after refactor |
| OrderCreationFlowTest | PASS (17/17) | Creation/pricing snapshots unaffected |
| CheckoutApiTest | PASS | Checkout regression clean |
| CheckoutPendingOrderRedesignTest | PASS | Pending-order flow clean |
| PaymentCheckoutTest | PASS | Payment checkout delegation clean |
| PaymentCallbackStressTest | PASS | Idempotent callback behavior preserved |
| PaymentProductionHardenTest | PASS (fixtures: price consistency added for invoice-generating paths) | All previously-green tests remain green |
| PaymentSystemTest | NOT RUN CLEAN (4 failures PRE-EXISTING on main) | Missing coupon_assignments test schema; 3 endpoint 500s — byte-identical to stash-verified baseline |
| EventSystemTest | NOT RUN CLEAN (9 failures PRE-EXISTING on main) | Queue/refund/provider assertions — byte-identical to baseline |

Result:
PASS — zero regressions introduced; all failures in untouched suites are pre-existing and documented in production-status.md.

## Full API Closure Audit (2026-08-23)

**Changed Feature:**
Cross-cutting audit fixes: routes/api.php + Marvel Routes.php (duplicate names, cashier action string, refunds auth, dashboard gate, whereNumber constraints), RefundController/Repository, ReviewController, PermissionSeeder (+create-review/update-review), constants.php (+11 message constants), ShipmentController, AdminMiddleware, OneTimePasswordNotification, DeviceTokenController, InvoiceController, FastShipping controllers (app+Marvel), FlashSaleVendorRequestController, BulkDeleteCategoriesRequest, FlashSale create/update requests, CouponController inline approval guard, limit caps in 6 public services, en/ar message.php (+19 keys), SendUserOrderDeliveredNotification duplicate-import fatal.

**Affected Features:**
- Checkout/Payments (cashier mark-paid endpoint restored)
- Dashboard analytics (now permission-gated)
- Shipments (translated messages)
- Reviews admin endpoints (permission-gated)
- Coupons apply (validation added)
- Flash sales (date-range validation)
- All public list endpoints (limit caps)

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| ProductionClosureAuditRegressionTest | PASS (15/15) | NEW - covers every fix: refunds auth/scoping/authorization, review gates, dashboard gate, flash-sale dates, whereNumber 404s, translated shipment messages, coupon-apply validation |
| ProductionClosureAuditRegressionTest + DashboardTest + ProductCrudTest | PASS (110/110) | Combined run |
| FlashSalesEndpointTest + SiteReviews suites + OrderStatusLifecycleTest + Settings suites | PASS (124/126) | Only failures: OrderStatusLifecycleTest x2 device_tokens (pre-existing uncommitted FCM workstream) |
| PaymentSystemTest | PASS for cashier endpoint tests (26/29) | mark-paid 500s FIXED by this audit; remaining 3 errors pre-existing (1 coupon_assignments schema gap + 2 FCM device_tokens) |
| Full suite | RUN | 3363 tests / 9973 assertions; all remaining errors/failures attributed to pre-existing causes: FCM workstream device_tokens (dominant signature), FinancialInvariant fixtures, documented route drift (WishlistApiTest, AttributesProductionHardenTest, FlashSaleApproveRequestTest dead routes), SQLite REGEXP limits (DimensionFilterTest). Clean-HEAD stash check confirmed CouponSystemTest fails identically without any session changes |
| route:cache | PASS | Was FAILING (duplicate names orders.index / pickup-locations.index) - deployment blocker resolved |

Result:
PASS - zero regressions introduced by audit fixes; all residual failures verified pre-existing.

- Brand Import (real dispatch replacing false log)
- Category Export / Brand Export (completed/failed terminals)
- Category Bulk Delete (chunk progress + completed/cancelled/failed)
- Product Export (UNTOUCHED by design - G3 deferred; sync path regression-proven)
- Queue policy (must remain meem-high for all 7 producers)

**Regression:**

| Suite | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| FileOperationEventContractTest (new) | PASS 4/4, 27 assertions | Channel/event-name/payload contract pinned |

| ProductionClosureAuditRegressionTest | PASS 15/15 | Cross-cutting closure proofs green |
| tests/Feature/Notifications | PRE-EXISTING | 135 run: 1 error + 4 failures verified BYTE-IDENTICAL with all implementation files stashed (path-limited stash baseline); unrelated to broadcasting |
| Full application suite | NOT RUN | Out of scope for this pass; targeted + affected-feature coverage executed |

Result:
PASS - zero regressions introduced; residual notification failures proven pre-existing.
